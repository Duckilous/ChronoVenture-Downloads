  Overview
------------
ChronoVenture is a momentum-based Gameboy-style platformer shooter where the player controls a cat named Lizzy as she runs, 
jumps, claws and shoots her way to the end of the level where she'll encounter against a boss to 
unlock a new weapon or ability before she finds herself warping into the future.

Taking inspiration from Sonic CD, you start off in Act 1 during the present or past of a stage where you can 
either focus on completing an objective that changes the future in Act 2 for the better or 
reach to the end as fast as you can for a tougher challenge.

This demo features:
- The first playable stage, Dryforest Drought
- 4 Usable Weapons
- 5 Unique Enemies
- 2 Bosses
- 4 Green Colours
- Roughly 5 Minutes of Gameplay
- Modern (4-Button) and Classic (2-Button) Control Options, with XInput Support
- Authentic Soundtrack and Sound Effects
- And not much else, it's a really short demo

---------------------
  Demo 1 [0.1] Info  
---------------------
This build of ChronoVenture consists of only the Dryforest Drought stage, with three acts.
Act 1 takes place in the present and Act 2 takes place in the future that 
changes depending on whether you completed your objective or not.
Your goal in Act 1 is to destroy all 8 torches to prevent possible bushfires that would burn up the forest. 
As Act 1 is quite short, finding all torches shouldn't be hard as long as you explore every route.
Otherwise, you can always ignore the goal and just run to the end of the level as fast as you can.

  Weapons
-----------
- **Claws** - Lizzy's own claws, her melee attack. Can be used to swipe against enemies on the ground or in the air.
- **Yarnbombs** - Lizzy's handcrafted bomb made out of yarn... somehow. Can instantly take out weak enemies and destroy breakable blocks.
- **Zapper** - A laser standard pistol that resembles a light gun. Useful for taking out enemies in a distance. Already unlocked for this demo.
- **Insecticider** - A modified water gun that squirts bug spray through a lighter. Essentially a flamethrower.

#### Notes
- While on the ground, Lizzy can throw yarnbombs and shoot lasers ahead of her, lowered when crouching or diagonally up when aiming up.
- While airborne, Lizzy can throw yarnbombs and shoot lasers in 8 directions.
- The Insecticider can only spray flames forward and lowered.

  Enemy List
--------------
### Native Critters:
- **Swooper** - An aggressive bird that swoops nearby prey they see.
- **Lil' Swooper** - A young but grouchy bird that pecks anyone they hop towards when awake.
- **Dropbear** - Koala-like creatures that hold onto trees or hide inside hollows until they see a prey to drop onto.

### Insectoids:
- **Bullant** - A bull ant who was instructed to build and guard torches but most of them just walk around aimlessly instead.
- **Firent** - A fire ant who only appears in Act 2B and walks like Bullants but highly inflammable. They run fast when lit on fire.

### Bosses:
- **Dipter** - A fly soldier who's been building one of the burning torches. Persistent but not much of a threat.
- **Megabear** - A bigger and tougher Dropbear that can expel fireballs. Resembles a certain prickly mammal in this demo.
